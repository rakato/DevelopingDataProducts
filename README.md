### Shiny App

My Shiny App takes several years of daily natural gas prices from the [EIA website] (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_fut_s1_d.htm) and graphs the data

APP Functionality:

Drop Down Menu- you can choose the number of historgram bins
1st Box Check-  allows for the user to place a line graph over the histogram 
2nd Box Check- allows for the user to show the daily distribution of prices at the bottom of the graph
